Time spent: 25 hours 

## Green target
Vulnerability #1: User enumeration
- When logging in the green target site the web developer gives away a hint of whether username is correct or not. When username is correct the 'Log in was unsuccessful.' error message appears in bold characters. When the username is incorrect than the error message appears in same format as the other fonts on the page. The red target and blue target do not have this vulnerability.

Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Scripting
- When user fills in the feedback form they can inject javascript code into the database due to the developer not handling what the user is inputting before they send information to the database. When the admin checks the feedbacks on this page. The scripts are rendered when the code is retrieved from the database.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery
- Hacker designs a hidden form in the user information page that when submitted changes the user information on the page. The red page has csrf token vulnerabulity that allows forms to be submitted successfully without a valid csrf token. As shown in the blue page. The blue age does not allow the hidden form to be submitted without a valid csrf token

## Blue target
Vulnerability #1: SQL injection
- In the blue site their is url sanitation problem where it is possible to inject sql code into the url parameter. The developer does not escape apostrophe characters. It is possible to inject a OR statement that lets you get a different user. In the red site it is not possible to inject sql statements because doing so redirects you to the all salesperson page.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking
- The target's logs in and the session is accessed. Using the targets session token the attacker is able to change his session id and automatically login without actually using the login form.
