## Green target
Vulnerability #1: User enumeration
- When logging in the green target site the web developer gives away a hint of whether username is correct or not. When username is correct the 'Log in was unsuccessful.' error message appears in bold characters. When the username is incorrect than the error message appears in same format as the other fonts on the page. The red target and blue target do not have this vulnerability.

Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Scripting
- When user fills in the feedback form they can inject javascript code into the database due to the developer not handling what the user is inputting before they send information to the database. When the admin checks the feedbacks on this page. The scripts are rendered when the code is retrieved from the database.
