## Green target
Vulnerability #1: User enumeration
- When logging in the green target site the web developer gives away a hint of whether username is correct or not. When username is correct the 'Log in was unsuccessful.' error message appears in bold characters. When the username is incorrect than the error message appears in same format as the other fonts on the page. The red target and blue target do not have this vulnerability.
